    <div class="callout_copy">
      <p>
        Sleepy Dog Productions is a leader in the movement to teach technical sophistication in the realm of <em>story-telling</em>––the seemingly magical ability to take
        command of your perspective, following a character's life and follow your dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creative decision making lies at the core of great filmmaking.
        To shoot a movie, you need to understand how the equipment works,
        but more importantly, you need to know how the choices you make—composition,
        exposure, lighting, etc.—impact the way the audience sees the film.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow along and learn the fundamentals required to shoot a story with a camera.
        Learn how to plan your production, assemble a crew, choose the right camera and lenses,
        and make creative choices that best fit the themes, characters, and story of your film.
        We covers the elements of composition, exposure, optics, lighting, and camera movement.
        Part 2 shows you how to put all these ideas together on set, and deliver the footage
        to an editor and director for assembly into a complete, coherent, and compelling story.

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Sleepy Dog Productions started with Ash Sunde and Victor Lam. Out of their student co-op and into the real world, came the dream of a pup who spoke thus:
        "I believe there are <em><strong>at least a billion people</strong></em> who can benefit from
        learning «the art of story-telling»... <br>and like probably more dude."
        <br>
        <br> They emerged from the Atacama Desert's Valle de Luna, rubbing a peyoté haze from their eyes. After a quick stop to the bodega for mushrooms, zucchinis, and pasta they encountered a strange fellow mewing. Thus, Gatito (née Zuko) was born.

            When he's not swimming with dolphins or hunting mushrooms on remote mountain steppes
         on his snowboard, you can find Victor on his laptop designing
         interfaces, practicing front-end development, or writing some of the
         interface-related Behance Live tutorials.

            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
            Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Gatito is a true nerd at
            heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour
            bus as he is from his kitchen table.
