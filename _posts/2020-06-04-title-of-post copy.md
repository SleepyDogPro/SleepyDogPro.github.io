<!--
I'm still the optimist though it is hard.
I believe that people can change
I blieve that the world is a boundless, wonderful place that we can re-make as we see fit.

I have good days and bad days. On my good days, I can feel so inspired in a lifting, elated, sublime way!
On my bad days, I often project on the environment around me--moving home would be a shame if I were to negatively reflect on my mental state as a byproduct of the my circumstances.

I am happy when I am in my own space, where I can feel free. It really mirrors my mental, spiritual space of freedom––This I know about myself. The mind  does work in weird, circuitous, mysterious ways, and I know the best way to appease mine is to listen to it. To feel inspired, like change is possible, I must be free.

In a space where I am responsible for myself, I know that the environment is shaped because of my decisions. Responsibilty for oneself, means that blame cannot be shunted off––that your state, and everything around you can be changed by your choices and actions.
